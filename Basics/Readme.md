# Basics

- mdn documentation
- ECMAScript - original documentation

## Variables

- const: to declare constant variables, which can't be changed
- let: to declare variables, whose value can be modified later. We use let now, because it uses scope
- var: to declare variables, whose value can be modified later. We don't use var because it doesn't work for scope

## Data Types

- number -> integer/float
- bigInt -> big integers
- string
- boolean -> true/false
- null -> standalone value (empty value)
- undefined -> when value isn't defined
- symbol -> unique

- object 

- typeof : used to check the data type of a value or a variable
Note: typeof null is *object* and typeof undefined is *undefined*


## Extras

- console.log(): for printing variable's value
- console.table([]): for printing more than one variable's value in the form of a table
- If we declare any variable and don't assign a value to it, it is declared as 'undefined'
- "use strict"; : written at the starting of the file and makes sure the newer version of JS is used
- alert(): it is used to send a pop-up message on the website. It can't be used on terminal
